                        <p>In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the mother of the boy, Paul.</p>
                        <p>It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.</p>
                        <p>The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.</p>
                        <p>By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor, the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow - hair like matted spiderwebs, a drawn face and two eyes that looked like dark stones.</p>
                        <div class="quote">
                            "He shall know your ways as though born to them," the old woman whispered.
                        </div>
                        <p>The testing had been going on for days, and Paul was tired of it. He didn't understand what they wanted from him. He was only fifteen, and he wanted to be out with Duncan and Gurney, learning the sword and the kindjal, not stuck inside with these strange women and their odd questions.</p>

                        <p>Paul's mother, Jessica, stood in the training room, her body still humming from the morning's workout. She had been a Bene Gesserit, a member of the ancient school that had perfected the mind and body, and though she had left the order, she maintained the disciplines.</p>
                        <p>She thought about the old woman's visit. The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam had come to test Paul, to see if he was the Kwisatz Haderach, the one who could be many places at once. The one the Bene Gesserit had been breeding for over ninety generations.</p>
                        <p>Jessica had broken the Bene Gesserit plan by bearing a son to Duke Leto instead of the daughter they had commanded. Now, she feared what the order might do in retaliation.</p>

                        <p>She thought of the Missionaria Protectiva, the arm of the Bene Gesserit that planted superstitions and religious myths on primitive worlds, preparing the way for members of the order who might need sanctuary someday. On Arrakis, they had planted the legend of the Lisan al-Gaib, the voice from the outer world, and the Mahdi, who would lead them to paradise.</p>
                        <p>Jessica knew these legends would be both protection and danger for her family on Arrakis.</p>

                        <p>They were being sent to Arrakis, the desert planet, the only source of the spice melange, the most valuable substance in the universe. It was supposed to be an honor, a promotion, but Leto knew it was a trap.</p>
                        <p>House Harkonnen, their mortal enemies, had been forced to relinquish control of Arrakis, and they would not take the insult lightly. The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was a vicious, cunning opponent who would stop at nothing to destroy House Atreides.</p>

                        <p>Leto thought of his son, Paul, and the strange abilities the boy was showing. He thought of Jessica, the woman he loved but could not marry because of political necessity. And he thought of the terrible weight of responsibility that came with leadership.</p>
                        <p>He would take his house to Arrakis, and he would do his best to protect them, but in his heart, he feared what was to come.</p>

From space, it looked dead, a dry ball of sand and rock, but he knew it held the most valuable substance in the universe.</p>
                        <p>Spice. Melange. The geriatric properties of the spice were well-known - it could extend human life. The navigators of the Spacing Guild used it to fold space, making interstellar travel possible. The Bene Gesserit used it in their rituals. Without spice, the Imperium would collapse.</p>

                        <p>He didn't know yet that the dreams were more than dreams, that they were visions of possible futures, or that his coming to Arrakis would set in motion events that would change the universe forever.</p>

                        <p>Stilgar, naib of Sietch Tabr, watched through his stillsuit's filter. The suit captured every drop of moisture from his body, recycling it for drinking. On Arrakis, water was life, and the Fremen had learned to conserve every precious drop.</p>
                        <p>They were a tough, resilient people, shaped by the desert. They knew things about Arrakis that the off-worlders could never understand. They knew how to find the hidden water, how to ride the great sandworms, how to survive in the harshest environment imaginable.</p>

                        <p>When it came, the attack was both subtle and brutal. Dr. Yueh, the family's Suk doctor, whose conditioning was supposed to make him immune to coercion, had betrayed them.
