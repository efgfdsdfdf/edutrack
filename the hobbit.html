                        <p>It had a perfectly round door like a porthole, painted green, with a shiny yellow brass knob in the exact middle. The door opened on to a tube-shaped hall like a tunnel: a very comfortable tunnel without smoke, with panelled walls, and floors tiled and carpeted, provided with polished chairs, and lots and lots of pegs for hats and coats — the hobbit was fond of visitors.</p>
                        <p>The tunnel wound on and on, going fairly but not quite straight into the side of the hill — The Hill, as all the people for many miles round called it — and many little round doors opened out of it, first on one side and then on another. No going upstairs for the hobbit: bedrooms, bathrooms, cellars, pantries (lots of these), wardrobes (he had whole rooms devoted to clothes), kitchens, dining-rooms, all were on the same floor, and indeed on the same passage.</p>

                        <p>This hobbit was a very well-to-do hobbit, and his name was Baggins. The Bagginses had lived in the neighbourhood of The Hill for time out of mind, and people considered them very respectable, not only because most of them were rich, but also because they never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.</p>
                        <p>One morning, while Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast, smoking an enormous long wooden pipe, Gandalf the wizard came by. Gandalf! If you had heard only a quarter of what I have heard about him, and I have only heard very little of all there is to hear, you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale.</p>
                        <p>Gandalf had been away over The Hill and across The Water on businesses of his own. It was many years since he had visited the parts where the hobbits lived, and Bilbo had been but a lad then. Still, he remembered the wizard, if only by his tall blue pointed hat and long grey cloak and silver scarf.</p>

                        <p>Up jumped Bilbo, and putting on his dressing-gown went into the dining-room. There he saw nobody, but all the signs of a large and hurried breakfast. There was a fearful mess in the room, and piles of unwashed crocks in the kitchen. Nearly every pot and pan he possessed seemed to have been used.</p>
                        <p>The washing-up was so dismally real that Bilbo was forced to believe the party of the night before had not been part of his bad dreams, as he had rather hoped. Indeed he was really relieved after all to think that they had all gone without him, and without bothering to wake him up (but with never a thank-you).</p>
                        <p>Just then there came a ring at the bell. And then another. "Who can that be?" he thought, and he hurried along the passage, very angry and altogether bewildered and bewuthered — this was the most awkward Wednesday he ever remembered.</p>
                        <div class="quote">

And there was Gandalf behind, leaning on his staff and laughing. He had made quite a dent on the beautiful door; he had also, by the way, knocked out the secret mark that he had put there the morning before.</p>
                        <p>"Carefully! Carefully!" he said. "It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! Let me introduce Bifur, Bofur, Bombur, and especially Thorin!"</p>
                        <p>Bilbo bowed. He had no hat to take off, and was feeling flushed and hot. "At your service!" he stammered.</p>
                        <p>They all sat round the large fire, and Thorin began to talk of their quest. He spoke of the dragon Smaug who had destroyed the dwarf kingdom under the Mountain, and stolen their treasure. He told of their plan to travel to the Lonely Mountain and reclaim their homeland.</p>

                        <p>They walked and walked, and besides the ordinary noises of the day, they heard no sound, and saw no sign of any living thing. The sun rose behind them and sank before them. The trees seemed to be listening, and the very rocks to be awake.</p>
                        <p>They were high up in a narrow place, with a dreadful fall into a dim valley at one side of them. There they rested for a while and had such food as they had; and the ponies were given a small feed of oats. The sun was already sinking behind the mountains, and their shadows were long and black behind them, when they noticed that the path ahead was blocked by a large stone.</p>
                        <p>It was a great stone, shaped somewhat like a sitting bear, and it was set right across the path, so that they had to squeeze round it. As they did so, they saw that there was an opening behind it, like the door of a small cave.</p>

                        <p>"This is the first stage of your journey, not the last," said a voice behind them. They turned and saw Gandalf standing near the stone, leaning on his staff. He had been following them, though they had not seen him.</p>
                        <p>"I think it is time you visited the elves," he said. "You need advice and a good rest. This way!" He pointed to the opening in the rock.</p>
                        <p>They passed through the narrow opening and found themselves at the top of a steep bank leading down into a secret valley. At the bottom they could see the lights of many fires, and the sound of singing came up to them. It was the elves of Rivendell.</p>
                        <p>They were welcomed by Elrond, the master of the house, a noble elf as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer. He looked at the map that Thorin carried and found moon-letters that none of them had seen before — secret writing that could only be read by the light of the moon.</p>

                        <p>Suddenly they heard a howl away down the valley behind them. Another followed, then another. The howling went on, and it seemed to be getting nearer. The dwarves and Bilbo stopped to listen.</p>
                        <p>"What is that?" asked Bilbo, his voice trembling.</p>

                        <p>"Up the trees, all of you!" he shouted. "Climb for your lives!"</p>
                        <p>They scrambled up the tall pines that grew close to the path. Just in time, for the wargs — great grey wolves of the mountains — came rushing into the clearing below. They snarled and snapped at the tree trunks, but could not reach the company.</p>
                        <p>Then something worse happened. The goblins came, sliding down the rocks and gathering in the clearing. They lit fires around the bases of the trees and began to sing a horrible song about roasting the dwarves and hobbit.</p>
                        <p>Just when things looked their worst, the eagles came. Great eagles of the mountains, led by the Lord of the Eagles himself, swooped down and carried the company to safety.</p>

                        <p>When Bilbo opened his eyes, he wondered if he had; for it was just as dark as with them shut. No one was anywhere near him. Just imagine his fright! He could hear nothing, see nothing, and he could feel nothing except the stone of the floor.</p>
                        <p>Very slowly he got up and groped about on all fours, till he touched the wall of the tunnel; but neither up nor down it could he find anything: nothing at all, no sign of goblins, no sign of dwarves.</p>
                        <p>His head was swimming, and he was far from certain even of the direction they had been going in when he had his fall. He guessed as well as he could, and crawled along for a good way, till suddenly his hand met what felt like a tiny ring of cold metal lying on the floor of the tunnel.</p>

                        <p>He put the ring in his pocket almost without thinking; certainly it did not seem of any particular use at the moment. Then he proceeded.</p>
                        <p>On he went, and down, and then he came to water — deep, dark, cold water. There was no way around that he could see. He was standing at the edge of an underground lake, and far away across the water he could see a tiny speck of light.</p>
                        <p>As his eyes grew used to the dimness, he noticed something sitting on a rock in the middle of the lake. It was Gollum. A small, slimy creature who lived in the dark, paddling his little boat and fishing with his long fingers.</p>
                        <p>Gollum saw Bilbo and was immediately interested. He had not had anything to eat for a long time, and a nice juicy hobbit would be just the thing. But Bilbo was quick to suggest a game of riddles — if he won, Gollum would show him the way out; if Gollum won, well...</p>
                        <p>The riddle game went on, each taking turns. Bilbo asked: "What has roots as nobody sees, is taller than trees, up, up it goes, and yet never grows?" Gollum eventually guessed it was a mountain.</p>
                        <p>Then it was Gollum's turn. After several riddles, Bilbo found himself stumped. He put his hand in his pocket and said, almost without thinking: "What have I got in my pocket?"</p>
                        <p>This wasn't a proper riddle, but Gollum agreed to give him three guesses. When Bilbo couldn't answer (for how could he know what he had in his own pocket?), Gollum demanded his prize. But Bilbo had discovered the ring made him invisible, and he followed Gollum to the exit, escaping just in time.</p>

                        <p>Creeping closer, he saw that it was Gandalf and the dwarves, arguing about whether to go back and look for him. Just as they had decided to give him up for lost, Bilbo stepped out from behind a tree.</p>
