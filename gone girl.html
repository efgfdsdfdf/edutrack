                        <p>The day of our fifth anniversary, I woke up alone. This wasn't unusual. Amy was an early riser, a quiet ghost in the morning. I found the note on the kitchen counter, propped against the fruit bowl. In her perfect, looping script, it read: "Well, hello, handsome. Don't forget the treasure hunt. A little something to spice up the day. Love you."</p>
                        <p>The Annual Anniversary Treasure Hunt. Amy's tradition. A series of clever, coy clues leading to a gift. I used to love them. Today, the thought felt like a weight in my chest. I poured coffee and tried to summon the enthusiasm.</p>
                        <p>The first clue was always in the house. I found it taped to the back of the pantry door: "I'm where you go to escape, but I'm also where we first met. Sort of."</p>
                        <p>The bar. The "and" was a stretch—we'd technically met at a party, but we'd had our first real conversation at a bar called The Dugout in New York. Now I co-owned a bar called The Bar with my twin sister, Go. Cute, Amy. Very cute.</p>
                        <p>I finished my coffee. The house was too quiet.</p>

                        <p>He practically glowed, this man, Nick Dunne. He was witty and sharp in that midwestern, self-deprecating way that felt so genuine after the preening boys of Harvard. At a literary party in Brooklyn, he found me hiding by the bookshelf. "A fellow escapee," he said, and his smile was a key turning in a lock I didn't know I had. We talked for hours. He made me feel <em>seen</em>, not as "Amazing Amy," the star of my parents' bestselling children's books, but as just me. We ended up at a dive bar, sharing a sticky booth and our life stories. He was the perfect man. I was going to be the perfect wife.</p>

                        <p>I drove to The Bar. It was closed, the air inside stale with last night's beer and smoke. My sister, Margo—Go—was already there, counting the till.</p>
                        <p>"Anniversary boy," she said, not looking up. "Shouldn't you be composing sonnets or something?"</p>
                        <p>"Amy's hunt. First clue led here."</p>
                        <p>Go finally looked at me. Her eyes, the same as mine, saw too much. "You okay? You look like hell."</p>
                        <p>"Rough night." I avoided her gaze. On the sticky surface of the bar, under a napkin dispenser, was the next clue. "Think of our first kiss. A sweet beginning."</p>
                        <p>A confectionery. The Sugar Shell, here in Carthage, Missouri. Not the same as the bakery near my old apartment in New York, but the sentiment held. I crumpled the clue in my fist.</p>
                        <p>"Nick?" Go's voice was laced with concern. "What's wrong?"</p>
                        <p>"Nothing," I said, too quickly. "I gotta go."</p>

                        <p>We lost our jobs on the same day. The recession, a cruel, faceless blade. I was a personality quiz writer; he was a magazine journalist. Both luxuries the world decided it could no longer afford. Then his father got sick, and his mother was fading fast. We moved to Carthage, Missouri, his hometown. A new beginning, he said. We'd buy a nice house on the river, be near Go, start a family. He used the last of my trust fund to buy that bar with his sister.</p>
                        <p>He's changing here. The charming, attentive Nick is being worn away, replaced by a sullen, distant man. He spends all his time at The Bar. He forgets our dinners. He looks at me sometimes with a blankness that chills me to the bone. I found a receipt in his pocket for a $1,200 watch. It wasn't for me.</p>

                        <p>The door from the garage into the kitchen was slightly ajar. That was odd. Amy was paranoid about locking doors. I pushed it open.</p>
                        <p>"Amy?"</p>
                        <p>Silence. The house was still. Too still.</p>
                        <p>I called her name again, my voice echoing in the vast, tastefully decorated space we couldn't really afford. Then I saw it. The living room table was overturned. A glass lay shattered on the floor. And there, by the fireplace, a single, violent smear of blood.</p>
                        <p>My heart stopped. The world narrowed to that dark, rusty streak on the pale wood floor.</p>
                        <p>I pulled out my phone, my hands shaking so badly I could barely dial 911.</p>

                        <p>The husband is always the first look. It's a rule for a reason. Nick Dunne stood on his perfect porch, handsome face pale, hands shoved deep in his pockets. He looked the part of the grieving husband. Almost too perfectly.</p>
                        <p>His story was simple. He left for the bar around noon. Came home just after two. Found the door open, the table overturned, his wife gone.</p>
                        <p>Inside, the scene was... theatrical. A staged struggle. Too neat. The only thing of real violence was the coffee table, which was flipped, and the blood spatter, which was minimal. The rest of the room was pristine.</p>
                        <p>"Notice anything missing, Mr. Dunne?" I asked.</p>
                        <p>He looked around, dazed. "I... I don't know. Her purse is gone. Her keys."</p>
                        <p>We found her day planner in her office. On today's date, she had written: "ANNIVERSARY! Dinner with Nick? Hopefully he remembers." The hopeful question mark felt like a punch. And in the bedroom, tucked deep in the back of her closet, we found it. A gun. Registered to Nicholas Dunne.</p>

                        <p>By the next morning, Amy Dunne was America's Sweetheart. "Amazing Amy" was missing. The press descended on Carthage like locusts. They showed pictures of her, blonde and beautiful, smiling. They showed pictures of our beautiful, empty house. They interviewed neighbors who described her as "sweet," "quiet," "a perfect wife."</p>
                        <p>They interviewed me. I stood on my porch, squinting in the Missouri sun, and pleaded for her safe return. I said all the right things. I loved my wife. I missed my wife. Please, bring her home.</p>
                        <p>I saw the headlines online an hour later.</p>
                        <p><em>HUSBAND'S COLD PLEA</em><br>
                        <em>DUNNE'S GAZE: GUILTY OR GRIEF-STRICKEN?</em><br>
                        <em>THE SMILE THAT DIDN'T REACH HIS EYES.</em></p>
                        <p>I had smiled. I had tried to look concerned. But the camera, it seemed, caught the truth I was hiding beneath the surface. A cold, hard knot of panic. Because I knew what they would find. And they were starting to look.</p>

                        <p>The police found her diary.</p>
                        <p>Detective Boney, with her kind eyes and sharp mind, sat across from me in my own living room. She didn't need an interrogation room; the whole world was watching my house.</p>
                        <p>"Nick," she said gently, "Amy's diary paints a... concerning picture of your marriage."</p>
                        <p>I said nothing. My mouth was dust.</p>
                        <p>"She writes about being afraid of you. About your temper. About financial pressures. She mentions a life insurance policy."</p>
                        <p>"There is one," I admitted. "For both of us. Standard."</p>
                        <p>"She writes about you having an affair."</p>
                        <p>The air left my lungs. I looked at Go, who was standing by the door, her face a mask of shock and dawning horror. I hadn't told her. I hadn't told anyone.</p>
                        <p>And then Boney delivered the final blow. "We found significant credit card debt, Nick. In Amy's name. Purchases you made. And we found a shed at your sister's property, down by the river. We'll be executing a search warrant there first thing in the morning."</p>
                        <p>The river. The woods behind Go's house. The place I told them I was walking to "clear my head" the afternoon Amy disappeared.</p>
                        <p>I looked from Boney's pitying face to Go's betrayed one, and I knew. I was standing at the center of a maze Amy had built for me long before she vanished. And every path led directly to me, the guilty husband. The monster.</p>
