                        <p>He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night. There were no wolves in the region, but once an animal had strayed during the night, and the boy had had to spend the entire next day searching for it.</p>

                        <p>That day, he had sold some wool to a merchant and had taken the opportunity to talk to the merchant's daughter. She was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors.</p>
                        <p>He had been to the town only once, the year before. The merchant had been impressed with the boy's ability to read. He allowed the boy to spend some time with his daughter, with the hope that one day she would marry someone who could read and write.</p>
                        <p>The boy had been thinking about the merchant's daughter all day. He was planning to return to the town in a year's time. He had already saved enough money to buy a hundred sheep.</p>

                        <p>Santiago had a recurring dream, one that he had had many times before. In it, a child would take his hand and transport him to the Egyptian pyramids. There, the child would tell him, "If you come here, you will find a hidden treasure."</p>
                        <p>But just as the child was about to show him the exact location, Santiago would wake up. He had never reached the pyramids in his dream, and he had no idea what the treasure might be.</p>
                        <p>He decided to visit a gypsy woman who lived in the nearby village of Tarifa. People said she could interpret dreams. He found her in a small house on the outskirts of the village.</p>

                        <p>The gypsy listened to his dream without interrupting. When he finished, she said, "This is a difficult dream to interpret. But the simplest things are also the most extraordinary things, and only the wise can see them."</p>
                        <p>"What does my dream mean?" Santiago asked.</p>
                        <p>"You must go to the Pyramids in Egypt. I have never heard of them, but if a child showed them to you, they exist. There you will find a treasure that will make you a rich man."</p>
                        <p>Santiago was disappointed. He had heard similar stories before. "I don't have the money to travel to Egypt," he said.</p>
                        <p>The gypsy then told him about a principle she called "beginner's luck." She said that it was the force that makes life seem more favorable to those beginning something new.</p>
                        <p>As he was leaving, she reminded him that he owed her one-tenth of the treasure if he found it. Santiago agreed, though he didn't believe he would ever go to Egypt.</p>

                        <p>Santiago was sitting in a plaza, reading a book, when an old man approached him. The old man was dressed in an old-fashioned way and carried a crystal glass in his hand.</p>
                        <p>"What are you reading?" the old man asked.</p>

                        <p>"It's what you have always wanted to accomplish. Everyone, when they are young, knows what their Personal Legend is. At that point in their lives, everything is clear and everything is possible. They are not afraid to dream, and to yearn for everything they would like to see happen to them in their lives."</p>
                        <p>Melchizedek explained that there is a great force in the universe that wants people to realize their Personal Legends. But as time passes, a mysterious force begins to convince them that it will be impossible for them to do so.</p>
                        <p>The old man told Santiago that he had to choose between his flock and his treasure. He gave Santiago two stones from his breastplate—one black, called Urim, and one white, called Thummim. He said they would help him read the omens.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, Melchizedek made Santiago promise to give him one-tenth of his sheep. Santiago agreed, and the next day he sold his flock and bought a ticket to Tangier, in Africa.</p>

                        <p>He had been warned about thieves in the city, but he didn't think it would happen to him. While trying to find his way to a hotel, a young man offered to help him. The young man spoke Spanish and seemed friendly.</p>
                        <p>They went to a cafe, and the young man offered to take Santiago to the pyramids. He said he had a brother who was a guide. Santiago trusted him and showed him his money. The young man grabbed the money and ran away.</p>

                        <p>The next day, hungry and desperate, he saw a crystal shop. The shop was dirty and the crystals were covered in dust. It seemed like business wasn't good.</p>
                        <p>Santiago offered to clean the crystals in exchange for something to eat. The crystal merchant, a man with a sad face, agreed. After Santiago had cleaned all the crystals, the merchant gave him food and allowed him to sleep in the shop.</p>
                        <p>Santiago began working for the crystal merchant. He noticed that the shop was in a good location but had few customers. He suggested putting crystals outside to catch the sunlight and attract people. The merchant was reluctant at first, but agreed to try.</p>
                        <p>The idea worked, and business improved. Santiago began making other suggestions—selling tea in crystal glasses, displaying crystals on different levels. Each time, the merchant resisted at first, but eventually agreed, and each time business improved.</p>

                        <p>But something had changed in him. The thought of being a shepherd no longer excited him. He remembered his Personal Legend and the treasure at the pyramids.</p>
                        <p>One day, an Englishman came into the shop. He was looking for information about alchemists. He had heard that there was a famous alchemist living in the desert oasis of Al-Fayoum.</p>

                        <p>The Englishman and Santiago began talking. The Englishman was fascinated by alchemy and had spent much of his family's fortune studying it. He believed that alchemy was not just about turning lead into gold, but about spiritual transformation.</p>
                        <p>He showed Santiago his books about alchemy. They were full of complicated symbols and diagrams. Santiago couldn't understand them, but the Englishman explained that alchemists believed in the Soul of the World, a force that connects all living things.</p>
                        <p>The Englishman was planning to travel to Al-Fayoum to find the alchemist. Santiago decided to join him. They would travel with a caravan across the Sahara Desert.</p>
                        <p>Before leaving, Santiago said goodbye to the crystal merchant. The merchant told him that he was proud of Santiago. He said that Santiago had helped him realize that he too had dreams, but he had been afraid to pursue them.</p>
                        <p>"You are trying to realize your destiny," the merchant said. "And I am only trying to hold on to what I have."</p>

                        <p>The caravan was large, with hundreds of people and animals. There were merchants, pilgrims, and soldiers for protection. The journey across the desert would take many weeks.</p>
                        <p>Santiago and the Englishman traveled together. The Englishman spent most of his time reading his books about alchemy. Santiago tried to read them too, but found them confusing.</p>
                        <p>Instead, Santiago began observing the desert. He learned to listen to the wind and watch the stars. He started to understand the language of the world without words.</p>

                        <p>One evening, sitting around the campfire, Santiago met a camel driver. The camel driver had been crossing the desert for many years. He told Santiago that he had once been a prosperous farmer, but a flood had destroyed everything he owned.</p>
                        <p>"At first, I was devastated," the camel driver said. "But then I realized that life was telling me to move on. Now I'm happier than I ever was as a farmer."</p>
                        <p>The camel driver explained that he lived in the present moment. He didn't worry about the future or dwell on the past. He said that happiness could be found in the simplest things—the taste of food, the warmth of a fire, the beauty of the stars.</p>
                        <p>Santiago began to understand what the Englishman's books were trying to say. Alchemy wasn't about complicated formulas; it was about understanding the language of the world and following one's heart.</p>
                        <p>As they traveled deeper into the desert, Santiago felt that he was getting closer to his Personal Legend. He could feel the Soul of the World around him, in the sand, the wind, and the stars.</p>

                        <p>Santiago told her about his Personal Legend and the treasure at the pyramids. Fatima said that she would wait for him to fulfill his destiny. She believed that true love doesn't hold someone back, but encourages them to follow their dreams.</p>

                        <p>As Santiago and the alchemist rode out of the oasis, Santiago felt both sad and excited. He was leaving behind the woman he loved, but he was getting closer to his treasure.</p>
                        <p>The alchemist told him that love never keeps a person from following their Personal Legend. If it does, it's not true love.</p>
