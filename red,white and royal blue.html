                        <p>Across the room, Prince Henry is holding court. Perfect Prince Henry with his perfect blond hair and his perfect smile and his perfect everything. Alex hates him.</p>

                        <p>Now, Alex is here representing his mother, the President of the United States. He's supposed to be on his best behavior. But Henry keeps looking over at him with that smug little smile, and Alex's patience is wearing thin.</p>
                        <p>The reception is in full swing when Henry approaches him. "Claremont-Diaz," he says in that posh accent of his. "I see you've managed not to spill anything on yourself. Impressive."</p>
                        <p>"Your Highness," Alex replies through gritted teeth. "I see you've managed not to be a complete prick. Equally impressive."</p>

                        <p>Henry finally looks at him, and there's something in his eyes that Alex hasn't seen before. Not anger, not disdain. Something softer. "Do you ever get tired of this?"</p>

                        <p>"No," Henry says quietly. "The performance. Always having to be what everyone expects."</p>

                        <p>At the hospital, they're both on their best behavior. They read to sick children, they sign autographs, they pose for photos. Henry is surprisingly good with the kids—gentle and patient in a way Alex wouldn't have expected.</p>
                        <p>On the way back to the White House, they sit in silence. The animosity between them feels different now. Less sharp, more complicated.</p>

                        <p>It's the most honest conversation they've ever had. Alex learns that Henry is nothing like the person he presents to the world. He's funny, and smart, and surprisingly self-deprecating.</p>
