                        <p>The train jolts and scrapes and screeches back to life, and we continue on our journey into London. I watch the houses on the other side of the track as they flash past, a blur of red and grey. They back right onto the railway, their gardens separated from the tracks only by a wire fence.</p>

                        <p>I see them every day, these houses, these people. I know them without ever having spoken to them. I know them from my daily commute, from watching them through the train window as we slow down at the signal.</p>
                        <p>There's the house with the yellow door, where a young couple lives. They're always out in their garden, laughing, drinking wine. They look so happy. And then there's the house with the blue shutters, where a woman lives alone. She's often on her terrace, reading, or just staring into space.</p>
                        <p>I call them Jess and Jason. I've made up names for them, stories about their lives. Jess is an artist, I think. Jason works in the city. They're in love, but they're having problems. I can tell by the way they sometimes stand apart from each other, not touching.</p>
                        <p>It's a game I play, making up stories about people I see from the train. It passes the time. It makes me feel less alone.</p>
                        <p>The train lurches to a stop. We're at the signal again. Right outside Jess and Jason's house. And today, something is different. Jess is in the garden, but she's not alone. There's a man with her, and it's not Jason.</p>
                        <p>They're standing very close together. Too close.</p>

                        <p>Her name is Megan Hipwell. I saw it on the news this morning. The missing woman. She's the one I called Jess.</p>
                        <p>The television in the corner of the pub is tuned to the news channel. They're showing a photograph of her—a pretty blonde woman with a wide smile. She looks different from how I imagined her. Happier, somehow.</p>

                        <p>They're interviewing her husband, Scott. He's distraught, his face pale, his eyes red-rimmed. He says she went missing on Saturday night. She told him she was going to see a friend, but she never came home.</p>
                        <p>I feel a strange connection to this woman. I've been watching her for months, inventing a life for her. And now she's gone.</p>
                        <p>The news report says the police are treating her disappearance as suspicious. They're asking for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
                        <p>I should tell them what I saw. The man in the garden with her. But what would I say? That I saw them from a train? That I don't even know who he was?</p>
                        <p>Besides, I'm not exactly a reliable witness. My memory isn't what it used to be. The drinking doesn't help.</p>
                        <p>I take another sip of my vodka tonic. The ice cubes clink against the glass. It's only midday, but I need it. The shaking has started, and the drink will help it stop.</p>
                        <p>I think about Megan Hipwell. About the man in her garden. And I wonder if I'm the only one who knows what I saw.</p>

                        <p>This is happening more often now. The blackouts. The lost time. It's frightening, not knowing what you've done, where you've been.</p>
                        <p>I stumble into the bathroom and look at myself in the mirror. My face is pale, my eyes bloodshot. The cut on my forehead is small but deep. How did it happen? Did I fall? Did someone hit me?</p>
                        <p>I try to piece together the previous evening. I was at the pub, watching the news about Megan Hipwell. I had a few drinks. Then... nothing.</p>
                        <p>My phone buzzes on the counter. It's a text from Tom, my ex-husband. "We need to talk about the house."</p>
                        <p>The house. Our old house. The one he lives in now with his new wife, Anna. The house I can't stop thinking about, the house I sometimes find myself standing outside of, watching them through the windows.</p>
                        <p>I don't reply to his text. Instead, I scroll through my photos. There's one I don't remember taking. It's dark and blurry, but I can make out a fence, a garden, a house with blue shutters.</p>
                        <p>Megan Hipwell's house.</p>

                        <p>I tell her about the man I saw in the garden with Megan. About how they were standing close together, how it looked intimate.</p>
                        <p>"Can you describe this man?" DI Riley asks, her pen poised over her notebook.</p>
                        <p>I try to remember. "He was tall. Dark hair. Well-dressed. I couldn't see his face clearly from the train."</p>
                        <p>It sounds pathetic, even to my own ears. A vague description of a man seen from a moving train.</p>
                        <p>DI Riley asks me about my relationship with Megan. Did I know her? Had I ever spoken to her?</p>
                        <p>"No," I say. "I just saw her from the train. I made up names for her and her husband. Jess and Jason."</p>
                        <p>I can see the skepticism in her eyes. She thinks I'm a lonely, unstable woman with too much time on her hands. And she's not entirely wrong.</p>
                        <p>Before she leaves, she asks me where I was on Saturday night, the night Megan disappeared.</p>
                        <p>I tell her I was at home, alone. I don't mention the blackout. I don't mention the photo on my phone.</p>

                        <p>Anna turns away from the window and looks at her daughter, Evie, playing on the floor. This is her life now. This beautiful house, this perfect family. She won't let Rachel ruin it.</p>

                        <p>She pushes the thought away. Tom wouldn't lie to her. He loves her. He left Rachel for her.</p>

                        <p>I was here on Saturday night. I saw Megan. She was arguing with someone. A man. I couldn't see his face, but I recognized his coat. It was Tom's coat.</p>
                        <p>My ex-husband. Arguing with Megan Hipwell on the night she disappeared.</p>
