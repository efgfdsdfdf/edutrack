                        <p>When I first received the call that Evelyn Hugo wanted me to write her biography, I thought it was a prank. Evelyn Hugo, the legendary film star, the woman whose name was synonymous with Hollywood glamour, wanted me, Monique Grant, a relatively unknown journalist at Vivant magazine, to tell her story.</p>
                        <p>I was sitting at my desk, staring at the blank screen of my computer, trying to come up with a compelling angle for a piece on office plants when my phone rang. My editor, Frankie, was on the other end, her voice uncharacteristically breathless.</p>
                        <p>"Monique, you're not going to believe this," she said. "Evelyn Hugo's people just called. She wants you to write her biography."</p>

                        <p>When she entered the room, I was struck by how beautiful she still was. At seventy-nine, her face was lined, but her eyes were the same brilliant green I remembered from her films. She moved with a grace that seemed innate, as if she'd been born knowing how to command a room.</p>
                        <p>"Monique," she said, extending her hand. Her voice was lower than I expected, huskier. "Thank you for coming."</p>

                        <p>"I've lied my entire life," she said matter-of-factly. "To the press, to my husbands, to the public. But I'm done with lies now. I want the truth to be known."</p>
                        <p>She told me she had chosen me specifically, though she wouldn't say why. I was both terrified and exhilarated. This could make my career, but I had no idea why she had picked me out of every writer in New York.</p>

                        <p>She explained how she'd met Erin at a local diner where she worked as a waitress. He was handsome in a rough way, with slicked-back hair and a leather jacket. He told her he was going to California to become a movie star.</p>
                        <p>"I saw my ticket out," Evelyn said. "I married him two weeks after we met. We drove to Los Angeles in his beat-up Ford, with all our worldly possessions in the back seat."</p>

                        <p>She started going to studio lots, trying to get noticed. She changed her name from Evelyn Herrera to Evelyn Hugo, believing it sounded more glamorous. She learned how to dress, how to speak, how to carry herself.</p>

                        <p>Don Adler was the golden boy of Hollywood, with blond hair, blue eyes, and a smile that made women swoon. They met on the set of "Little Women," where Evelyn had a supporting role and Don was the male lead.</p>

                        <p>"The first time he hit me, I was shocked," Evelyn said, her voice steady. "The second time, I knew I had to get out. But leaving Don Adler wasn't as simple as leaving Erin Duke."</p>
                        <p>She explained how the studio pressured her to stay, how they worried about the bad publicity a divorce would cause. But Evelyn was determined. She filed for divorce after fourteen months of marriage.</p>
